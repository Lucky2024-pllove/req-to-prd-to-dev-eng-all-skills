    <strong>Requirements → PRD → Dev spec → Engineering delivery</strong><br>
    A monorepo of open <strong>SKILL.md</strong> packs for agents: turn fragmented asks into analyzable requirements and a PRD, then into developer-facing specs and tests, then into assignments, DoD, and delivery checklists. Each subdirectory can be <strong>mounted alone</strong> or used in sequence. Outputs are <strong>Markdown-first</strong> for Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, and similar runtimes.

## What this solves

Early-stage product work often needs **consistent, traceable documents**—not bullet lists in chat. This repo splits the common path into three mountable skills, each with `SKILL.md`, `references/`, and optional `demo/`:

- **One stage only** — e.g. you already have a PRD → use `prd-to-dev-spec/` alone  
- **Full pipeline** — requirements → PRD → dev spec/tests/confirmation → engineering delivery

## Three-skill pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  R[Raw requirements] --> S1[requirements-to-prd]
  S1 --> A[Analysis + PRD]
  A --> S2[prd-to-dev-spec]
  S2 --> B[Dev spec + tests + confirmation]
  B --> S3[engineering-delivery]
  S3 --> C[Assignments + todolist + checklist]
  S1 -.->|optional| F[lark-cli to Feishu]
```

| Step | Directory | Input → output | Notes |
|:--:|-----------|----------------|-------|
| 1 | [requirements-to-prd/](requirements-to-prd/) | Fragments → **analysis + PRD** | EARS/GWT, atomization; **optional** Feishu export |
| 2 | [prd-to-dev-spec/](prd-to-dev-spec/) | Reviewed PRD → **dev spec + tests + confirmation** | FR/AC traceability, UI/control detail, AI extensions |
| 3 | [engineering-delivery/](engineering-delivery/) | Approved materials → **assignments + todolist + checklist** (+ **AI task cards** when coding agents implement) | RACI, DoD, AIC one-at-a-time; DB scripts as drafts only |

See each subdirectory **README** for prompts and layout.

---

## Quick start

### Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lucky2024-pllove/req-to-prd-to-dev-eng-all-skills.git
cd req-to-prd-to-dev-eng-all-skills
```

Add the **subdirectory you need** to your agent’s skills path (per Cursor / Claude Code docs). You do **not** need to mount the monorepo root.

### Single skill

| Goal | Mount | Sample prompt |
|------|-------|---------------|
| PRD pack | `requirements-to-prd/` | “Use requirements-to-prd SKILL.md for analysis + PRD.” |
| PRD → engineering | `prd-to-dev-spec/` | “Use prd-to-dev-spec for dev spec, tests, confirmation checklist.” |
| Delivery | `engineering-delivery/` | “Use engineering-delivery for assignment plan, todolist, delivery checklist.” |
| Delivery + coding agents | `engineering-delivery/` | “Also output AI-Agent task cards; link implementation todolist items to AIC-xxx.” |

### Full sequence

1. [requirements-to-prd/SKILL.md](requirements-to-prd/SKILL.md)  
2. [prd-to-dev-spec/SKILL.md](prd-to-dev-spec/SKILL.md)  
3. [engineering-delivery/SKILL.md](engineering-delivery/SKILL.md)

## Demo regression chain

Maintainers can run a lightweight **DailyBill** end-to-end check (structure/traceability, not byte-identical gold files):

| Stage | Path |
|-------|------|
| Requirements → analysis + PRD | [requirements-to-prd/demo/](requirements-to-prd/demo/) |
| PRD → dev tri-pack | [prd-to-dev-spec/demo/](prd-to-dev-spec/demo/) |
| Materials → delivery | [engineering-delivery/demo/](engineering-delivery/demo/) |

---

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Applies to | Required? |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| SKILL.md-capable agent | All | **Yes** |
| [@larksuite/cli](https://github.com/larksuite/cli) | Feishu export in skill 1 only | No |
| Markdown / Mermaid | Reading long outputs | No |
